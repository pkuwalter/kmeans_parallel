kmeans-cpu
==============================

A baseline K-Means program on CPU (serial)

Using Lloyd's algorithm.

In each iteration, for each point, its distances to the cluster centroids are calculated. Re-clustering is done by assigning points to their nearest centroid. Then, the new centroids are got by averaging the coordinates of all the points in the same cluster.


Usage: ./kmeans-cpu [switches] -i filename -n num_clusters
       -i filename    : file containing data to be clustered
       -n num_clusters: number of clusters (K must > 1)
       -t threshold   : threshold value (default 0.0010)

\section{Sequential Algorithm}
K-means clustering is an NP-hard problem in general Euclidean space 
$\mathbb{R}^d$~\cite{k-means-euclidean}
and even for instances on a plane~\cite{k-means-plane}. The sequential
algorithm below is a heuristic algorithm which does not guarantee
a global optimal. 

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Sequential k-means clustering} \label{seq}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \INPUT $K$: Number of clusters; $N$: number of d-dimensional data points; $p$: data points. 
    \Function{seq\_k-means}{$p, N, K$}
    \State Randomly generate $K$ points as cluster centroids $c[]$
    \While {!termination\_condition }
    \For {i = 1..N}
    \For {j = 1..K}
    \For {dd = 1..d}
    \State $distance += (p(i)(dd) - c(j)(dd))^2$
    \EndFor
    \EndFor
    \State Find the nearest centroid $c_{nearest}$ for $p(i)$
    \State Assign each point to the nearest cluster centroid
    \State Accumulate $p(i)$'s coordinates
    \State divide the accumulated coords by num\_points to get the new centroid
    \EndFor
    \EndWhile
    \EndFunction
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Suppose m is the number of iterations in a run. \\
The complexity of this algorithm is O(NKdm).
